A high-performance low-memory chess game "platform" for highly parallel and
performant code.

For a while, I'd been meaning to work on developing a chess engine using machine
learning and reinforcement learning. However, I quickly found that all the software
I found to play chess on were rather slow, limiting the amount of moves I could
test in a small period of time. Hence, this project was started.
